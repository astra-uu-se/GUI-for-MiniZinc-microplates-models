# MPLACE Progress Tracking

This document tracks the progress of key tasks in the MPLACE project.

## Current Status

| Priority | Item                             | Status         | Details                                                                                      |
|----------|----------------------------------|----------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| High     | Implement MVC Architecture       | Not done yet   | UI, logic, and I/O are still coupled across main.py, WindowGenDZN.py, and WindowVisuals.py; no clear Model/View/Controller separation observed. |
| High     | Add Comprehensive Error Handling | Done           | All generic except: blocks replaced with specific exceptions (ValueError, TypeError, KeyError, etc.); proper exception chaining with 'from e' added; user-friendly error dialogs implemented throughout all modules. |
| High     | Improve Resource Management      | Done           | Context managers for all file operations; matplotlib figures properly closed with pyplot.close(fig); defensive error handling in plotting ensures figures freed on failure; UI state consistency maintained across error paths; subprocess handling preserved as tested and working. |
| Medium   | Code Style Standardization      | Done           | Comprehensive docstrings added to all functions with Args, Returns, Raises sections; consistent comment formatting throughout; proper type annotations on function parameters and returns. |
| Medium   | Add Comprehensive Type Hints    | Done           | Complete type annotations added across all modules using typing imports (List, Dict, Tuple, Union, Sequence); function signatures, class attributes, and global variables properly typed; numpy arrays and complex generic types annotated. |
| Medium   | Implement Consistent Naming Conventions | Done        | Constants converted to UPPERCASE (LETTERS_CAPITAL, LETTERS_LOWERCASE); variables use descriptive names (drugs, controls, num_rows, num_cols); UI elements follow consistent snake_case naming; preserved COMPD tool-specific naming. |
| Medium   | Configuration Management         | Partially done | paths.ini parsing centralized in utility.read_paths_ini_file with clearer error messages; still no dedicated config module or validation schema; GUI holds configuration state. |
| Low      | Performance Optimizations       | Not done       | No apparent performance-specific work; visualization likely fine for typical plate sizes; no caching or vectorization beyond basic numpy usage. |
| Low      | Enhanced User Experience         | Not done       | Core flows functional; user messages improved on errors; no UX enhancements like progress indicators beyond simple labels; fixed save paths for PNG still a limitation. |

## Recent Completions (October 16, 2025)

### ✅ Add Comprehensive Error Handling - COMPLETED (Morning)
**What was done:**
- Replaced all generic `except:` blocks with specific exceptions across all modules
- Added proper exception chaining using `from e` syntax  
- Implemented user-friendly error dialogs with `tk.messagebox.showerror`
- Enhanced error messages with context and troubleshooting hints

**Files modified:** utility.py, main.py, WindowVisuals.py, WindowGenDZN.py

### ✅ Code Style Standardization - COMPLETED (Morning)
**What was done:**
- Added comprehensive docstrings to all functions with Args, Returns, Raises sections
- Standardized comment formatting and indentation throughout codebase
- Applied consistent code organization and structure

**Files modified:** utility.py, main.py, WindowVisuals.py, WindowGenDZN.py

### ✅ Implement Consistent Naming Conventions - COMPLETED (Morning)
**What was done:**
- Converted constants to UPPERCASE: `letters_capital` → `LETTERS_CAPITAL`
- Renamed variables for clarity: `drgs` → `drugs`, `ctrs` → `controls`  
- Updated parameter names: `m, n` → `num_rows, num_cols`
- Standardized UI elements to snake_case naming
- Preserved tool-specific names like COMPD (specific tool, not truncated "compound")

**Files modified:** utility.py, main.py, WindowVisuals.py, WindowGenDZN.py

### ✅ Add Comprehensive Type Hints - COMPLETED (Mid-morning)
**What was done:**
- Added complete type annotations across all modules using typing imports
- Function signatures properly typed with `List[str]`, `Dict[str, np.ndarray]`, `Union` types, etc.
- Class attributes and global variables annotated (ToolTip class, UI widgets, StringVars)
- Complex generic types properly handled: `Sequence[Union[str, float, int]]`
- Fixed `parse_control_string` docstring to correctly indicate it returns a stringified list
- Preserved all existing behavior while adding comprehensive type safety

**Files modified:** utility.py, main.py, WindowVisuals.py, WindowGenDZN.py

### ✅ Improve Resource Management - COMPLETED (Just now)
**What was done:**
- **Matplotlib cleanup**: Enhanced `cleanup_canvas_widgets` to use `pyplot.close(fig)` for proper memory deallocation
- **Defensive plotting**: Added try/except blocks in `draw_plate` and `draw_material_scale` to close figures if plotting fails
- **UI state consistency**: Enhanced `run_minizinc` to restore original label text on user cancellation or file write errors
- **Window cleanup**: Added `finally` block in `on_close` to guarantee root window destruction
- **Preserved working solutions**: Intentionally kept subprocess handling and timeout logic as designed (PLAID can run for hours legitimately, COMPD manages own timeout)

**Files modified:** WindowVisuals.py, main.py

## Analysis Notes

### Resource Management Assessment - COMPLETED
- **Current state**: Robust resource lifecycle management with proper cleanup guarantees
- **Strengths**: Context managers for all file I/O, matplotlib figures explicitly closed, UI state preserved across error paths
- **Subprocess handling**: Preserved tested Windows/POSIX solution; no arbitrary timeouts that could interrupt legitimate long-running PLAID optimizations
- **Memory management**: Matplotlib backend properly releases figure memory; defensive error handling prevents resource leaks

### Code Quality Assessment  
- **Current state**: Professional-grade code with comprehensive documentation, type safety, and robust error handling
- **Strengths**: Full docstring coverage, consistent formatting, complete type annotations, specific exception handling
- **Type safety**: All functions, classes, and variables properly typed for better IDE support and error prevention

### Architecture Assessment
- **Current state**: Monolithic GUI architecture with coupled concerns
- **Next steps**: Extract data models, separate business logic, implement controller layer

## How to Update This File
